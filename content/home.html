<h1>Welcome to Warewulf</h1>

<p>
Warewulf is a scalable systems management suite originally developed to
manage large high-performance Linux clusters. Focused on general scalable
systems management, it includes a framework for system configuration,
management, provisioning/installation, monitoring, event notification, and
more via a modular plugin architecture. Install the components and features
you need or leverage the existing system configurations stored within
Warewulf to create custom solutions to meet your particular needs. Warewulf
is a flexible solution that has proven itself to be scalable and easy to use.
